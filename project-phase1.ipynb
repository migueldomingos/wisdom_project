    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Organization in Embedding Space\n",
    "In **semantic search**, each document is transformed into a vector and positioned within a **high-dimensional space**. Documents with similar meanings are placed **close together**, regardless of the actual words used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **traditional search**, documents are stored based on **text terms and frequencies**. The index organizes data around **keyword occurrence**, not meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Proximity-Based Search\n",
    "In the **embedding space**, search is performed by finding documents that are **nearest neighbors** to the query vector. This means results are selected based on **semantic similarity**, not shared vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **traditional search**, relevance is determined by **keyword overlap and frequency**. The system doesn’t consider whether two different words or phrases mean the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Flexibility in Querying\n",
    "**Semantic search** enables queries to return documents based on the **meaning alignment**, even if no keywords match directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional search** would require the exact terms to appear in the document to be considered relevant, limiting its ability to understand **context or nuance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Dimensional Context\n",
    "The **embedding space** captures **contextual relationships** across hundreds of dimensions. This allows it to distinguish between similar words used in **different contexts** (e.g., `\"apple\"` the fruit vs. `\"Apple\"` the company).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional indexing** does not capture this level of nuance—it treats words more **literally and statically**.\n"

    "#### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Layer 0: Initial Embeddings (Non-contextualized)**\n",
    "   - Tokens are close together and not semantically distinct.\n",
    "   - This layer contains basic wordpiece and position embeddings before any attention is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Middle Layers (Layers 3–7): Emerging Context**\n",
    "   - Tokens begin to spread out.\n",
    "   - Contextual differences become visible — e.g., `\"victorious\"` starts to drift away from `\"hands\"` or `\"his\"`.\n",
    "   - The model begins to shape representations based on surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deeper Layers (Layers 8–11): Fully Contextualized Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Tokens are well-separated and semantically meaningful.\n",
    "   - Embeddings reflect deep contextual understanding (e.g., `\"hands\"` vs. `\"victorious\"` are clearly distinct).\n",
    "   - Special tokens like `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` are positioned separately, indicating their functional role in the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Token Stability vs. Drift**\n",
    "   - Some tokens (e.g., `\"he\"`, `\"hands\"`) move significantly across layers.\n",
    "   - Special tokens (e.g., `[SEP]`) remain relatively stable, as their role is consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- The embeddings start out **non-contextualized** and become **increasingly informed by sentence context** as we move up the layers.\n",
    "- This layered transformation allows BERT to encode rich semantic relationships, which are crucial for tasks like classification, ranking, or semantic search.\n",
    "- Visualizing these embeddings reveals how each layer contributes to building up meaning, culminating in task-specific representations in the final layers."

    "#### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Token Uniqueness via Position**\n",
    "   - Even though all tokens are `\"hello\"`, their embeddings differ.\n",
    "   - This difference is due to **positional encodings** added before the first layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Early Layer Behavior**\n",
    "   - In Layer 0, the tokens already diverge — showing that **positional encoding is added at the embedding stage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Later Layers Reveal Positional Structure**\n",
    "   - From Layer 8 onward, tokens are organized in **structured arcs**, reflecting their **relative positions** in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Tokens Are Isolated**\n",
    "   - `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens are consistently separated, showing they are **functionally unique**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers successfully encode **position** via embeddings, even for identical tokens. Over layers, the network maintains and enhances this information, enabling it to understand **word order and relative position** — a crucial property for handling natural language sequences."

    "- Attention heads behave differently — some focus on syntax (e.g., function words), others on semantics (e.g., verbs or sentiment words).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: Cross-encoders capture **fine-grained relationships** between words, making them highly effective for tasks requiring deep understanding, like natural language inference or question answering.\n",

    "#### Dual Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dual encoder, **each sentence is encoded independently**, without any interaction at the token level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- No attention is computed between tokens across sentences — each input is processed in isolation.\n",
    "- No attention heatmaps can be generated between sentence pairs.\n",
    "- Only final sentence embeddings (pooled outputs) are compared — typically using **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "- The model prioritizes **speed and scalability** over fine-grained interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: Dual encoders are ideal for **semantic similarity and retrieval tasks**, where you need fast comparison of many sentences — but they lack interpretability and detailed attention dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Head Self-Attention — **Layer 11 (Cross-Encoder)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Attention Emergence**: Several heads (e.g., **Head 0, 1, 2, 4, 5**) display clear attention **across the `[SEP]` boundary**, showing alignment between question and sentence tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Token Dynamics**:\n",
    "  - `[CLS]` tokens (Heads **0, 1, 5**) receive broad attention — acting as an **information aggregator** for both segments.\n",
    "  - `[SEP]` tokens are focal points in multiple heads (e.g., **Heads 1, 10**), likely encoding **segment boundaries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Alignment**:\n",
    "  - **Head 2** strongly links question tokens like `\"what\"` to sentence tokens like `\"raises\"` or `\"hands\"` — indicating **semantic matching**.\n",
    "  - Some attention appears to link `\"he\"` across sentence/question, showing **entity resolution** behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced Locality**:\n",
    "  - Unlike earlier layers, **few heads show diagonal self-attention** (except Head 8). This suggests a shift from **syntactic structure** to **semantic reasoning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Head Specialization**:\n",
    "  - Some heads (e.g., 0, 2, 4) specialize in **cross-segment relevance**.\n",
    "  - Others (e.g., Head 8) maintain **identity or positional encoding**.\n",
    "  - A few (e.g., Head 6) contribute weakly, hinting at **redundancy or overcapacity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:  \n",
    "By **Layer 11**, the model shifts from structural parsing to **deep semantic processing**, linking **question intents** with **answer content**. Attention is no longer confined to local syntax — it is distributed across segments and guided by task-specific goals (like MSMARCO’s relevance ranking). Specialized heads play critical roles in **semantic fusion**, while weaker heads could be **pruned or distilled** for efficiency.\n",

    "#### Token-Level Similarity in Dual Encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "Although dual encoders do not provide cross-token attention, we can still analyze **semantic alignment between tokens** using cosine similarity between token embeddings of each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- Pronouns such as `\"he\"` in the question tend to align closely with `\"he\"` in the sentence, indicating proper referential understanding.\n",
    "- Verbs like `\"raise\"` show strong similarity with their conjugated forms like `\"raises\"`, reflecting the model's ability to capture morphological relationships.\n",
    "- `[CLS]` tokens are highly similar, as they both represent global sentence-level meaning.\n",
    "- Punctuation and structural tokens like `[SEP]` and `\".\"` often have low similarity with semantic tokens, though they may align with each other due to similar positional roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: While dual encoders do not compute attention between sequences, analyzing token embedding similarity reveals that the model still encodes meaningful semantic relationships. This can provide interpretability at a coarse level, especially useful for understanding what drives the final sentence embedding similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-encoders** provide rich interpretability through attention maps and capture deep contextual relationships — but are computationally expensive.\n",
    "- **Dual encoders** are lightweight and fast, making them practical for large-scale applications — but offer no visibility into token-level interactions.\n",
    "- The choice between them depends on the **task requirements**: precision vs. speed, interpretability vs. scalability."

    "### Interpretability: Attention Received by Tokens Across Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows how much **total attention each token receives** across the 12 transformer layers for the sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"He raises his hands feeling victorious.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line represents a token, and its value at each layer indicates how much attention it received from all other tokens combined (summed across all attention heads).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[CLS] Token Behavior**\n",
    "   - Receives a significant amount of attention in **early (Layers 0–2)** and **late (Layers 10–11)** stages.\n",
    "   - This aligns with its role as the **summary token**, aggregating sentence-level meaning for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[SEP] Token Behavior**\n",
    "   - Dominates the middle layers (especially **Layers 4–9**) in terms of attention received.\n",
    "   - This might reflect its role in separating segments or as a structural marker the model relies on to anchor information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"he\" Token Stands Out**\n",
    "   - The token `\"he\"` receives unusually high attention in **Layers 5–9**, surpassing even structural tokens.\n",
    "   - This suggests the model identifies `\"he\"` as a central semantic component, possibly due to it being the subject of the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content Words (e.g., \"hands\", \"victorious\")**\n",
    "   - Receive **moderate and stable attention** throughout the layers.\n",
    "   - Tokens like `\"victorious\"` and `\"raises\"` show some variance, indicating they contribute to the evolving meaning but aren’t the primary focus of attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Function Words (e.g., \"his\", \"feeling\", \".\")**\n",
    "   - These tokens receive consistently **low attention**, showing they are less critical in shaping the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokens that are **structurally important** (`[CLS]`, `[SEP]`) and **semantically central** (`\"he\"`) receive the **highest total attention**.\n",
    "- The model learns to focus its attention **dynamically across layers**, initially on structure, then content, and finally back to the `[CLS]` token for producing the final output.\n",
    "- This behavior confirms that attention received is a strong indicator of **token importance**, which helps explain **how the model constructs meaning** layer by layer.\n",
